# ReactPress

Easily create, build and deploy React apps into your existing WordPress sites.

Get started in seconds and develop your React app with instant feedback and your WordPress theme in mind.

Combine the flexibility of WordPress with the UI capabilities of React and seamlessly integrate create-react-app into your WordPress project for your next SaaS.

ReactPress does 3 things:

- It integrates your local dev server into your WordPress theme, that you have instant feedback, how your React app looks in the context of your WordPress website.
- It builds your React app in a way that it is usable from your WordPress site.
- It makes it easy to upload your app to a live server after building.
